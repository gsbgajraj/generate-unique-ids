Node.js + Express + MongoDB with Auto-Generated Custom ID
This is a simple Node.js and Express application that automatically generates an additional unique ID (customId) for each document in MongoDB using UUIDv4, in addition to the default MongoDB _id.

Features
Automatically generates a customId using UUIDv4 when creating new documents.
Minimal setup with a single server.js file.
MongoDB integration with Mongoose for schema and database operations.
Installation and Setup
1. Clone the Repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
Then, navigate into the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd your-repo-name
2. Install Dependencies
Install all required dependencies using npm:

bash
Copy code
npm install
3. Create a .env File
Create a .env file in the root directory of the project, and add your MongoDB connection URI:

makefile
Copy code
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
PORT=5000
Replace your_mongodb_connection_string with the actual connection string to your MongoDB instance.

4. Start the Server
Start the Express server by running:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The server should now be running on the port you defined in your .env file (default: 5000).

API Usage
POST /api/example
This endpoint allows you to create a new document with a custom ID.

Example Request:
bash
Copy code
POST /api/example
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Sample Name",
  "description": "This is a sample description."
}
Example Response:
json
Copy code
{
  "_id": "64e1214e248ea2c3d5a87fdc",
  "customId": "2e1c9d3e-b48e-40dd-a383-e9389bb3f2ea",
  "name": "Sample Name",
  "description": "This is a sample description.",
  "__v": 0
}
_id: The default MongoDB ObjectId.
customId: A unique identifier generated using UUID.
name and description: The data you provided.
Error Handling
If something goes wrong during the request, you will receive a 500 status code along with an error message in the response.

Example Error Response:
json
Copy code
{
  "message": "Error creating example",
  "error": "Detailed error message"
}
File Structure
This project is kept simple, with everything in a single server.js file.

bash
Copy code
my-express-app/
├── server.js       # Main application file
├── package.json    # Project configuration and dependencies
├── .env            # Environment variables (MongoDB URI and Port)
└── README.md       # This documentation file
server.js
The core logic of the app is in server.js, where we:

Connect to MongoDB.
Define the Mongoose schema, including the customId.
Create an Express route to handle document creation.
Dependencies
express: Web framework for building RESTful APIs.
mongoose: MongoDB ODM to interact with the database.
uuid: Used to generate unique custom IDs.
dotenv: Loads environment variables from a .env file.
